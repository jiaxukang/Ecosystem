PA8-Crispr-GUI (Status: posted October 30)
Learning Objectives
The goal of this assignment is to use basic JavaFX to create a GUI output representation of the PA6-Crispr program.

Another important goal is to improve the code clarity and decomposition from the PA6 programming assignment.

The Assignment
In class on Thursday 10/18 we talked about ways to consider improving your PA6-Crispr implementation. In this assignment, you will build on the improved PA6-Crispr implemention to visually represent your ecosystem simulation. Note that PA8 is due AFTER Midterm 2 on Wednesday November 7th.

For PA8, you will be graphically representing each animal in the output as well as handling a delay command from the input file that represents how long to wait between the execution of commands. In the video example files in the publicTestcases folder, each animal (i.e., each character from the PA6 output) is represented by uniquely colored tile on a canvas.

Please open and watch 'PublicTestCases/Ecosystem.mov' to see an example GUI output for the input file 'PublicTestCases/Ecosystem.in'.
You will be creating a variant of Ecosystem.in for your own unique animal object.

You should also be looking at the PA6-Crispr writeup to refresh your memory on how it works: https://github.com/UACS210Fall2018/PA-Drill-Section-Writeups/tree/master/PA6-Crispr

Delay parameter
The input file format for this assignment is exactly the same as that of PA6-Crispr, except that you will now have to handle a delay parameter. The delay will be specified on the third line of the input file right under the 'cols' parameter. An example input is shown below:

rows: 1
cols: 1
delay: 3.0

CREATE (0,0) lion left
CREATE (2,2) warbler 3
CREATE (5,5) giraffe right
MOVE
The number after 'delay:' is a double that represents the time to wait before each command executed. In the video example (PublicTestCases/Ecosystem.mov), this delay was set to .5, therefore, each command was executed after waiting a half second.

PA6 Requirement Changes
Your code from PA6 should behave according to the PA6 writeup except in the following ways:

When animals reproduce the baby should be assigned a gender randomly
Baby mammals created from a reproduce command should be assigned a direction randomly
Baby birds created from a reproduce command should be assigned a step value between 1 and 10 randomly
Baby insects created from a reproduce command should be assigned a clockwise boolean randomly
The above changes will lead to a more interesting simulation.

Steps for completing this assignment
See a tutorial on how to install the JavaFX plugin in Eclipse at (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FUROjRbvIi_WKNYJ-00uprIo2YPHDNd72SrqgwaqKis/edit?usp=sharing). The tutorial is also posted on the CS 210 resources webpage (https://piazza.com/arizona/fall2018/csc210/resources).

Accept the github assignment for PA8, [https://classroom.github.com/a/myPY3vPx]. Import your PA8 github repository into Eclipse as usual.

Run the given starter code and see what it does.

Copy your PA6 code into the Eclipse project.

Fix any issues that your PA6 submission had. Make the above changes to the PA6 requirements.

Implement the TODO items in the provided PA8Main.java.

Create your own copy of Ecosystem.in called myEcosystem.in that includes creating your unique animal.

Make a video of running myEcosystem.in through your program. Please consider creating a video file with https://obsproject.com/. The quick start instructions (https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart) are pretty helpful.

Run the PA8Main and leave up the java Ecosystem window.
Go into OBS.
In OBS, click on Settings in lower right corner and output. Check that output is mp4 or mov.
Click on the add button for a Source. Select Window Capture, which is at the end of the list.
Select Create New.
Then select the java [Ecosystem] window in the drop down list that starts out looking blank.
At some point you may need to Add Existing Source to get the window to show up in OBS.
Then quit the java [Ecosystem]
Then in quick succession (kludgy part), click on start recording in OBS and then run Ecosystem in eclipse. A movie file will be put in whatever directory was specified in Settings. If you can figure out how to start recording right when the app starts running, please post that information on piazza.

General requirements
This assignment is different from other assignments you've had so far in that you are given a lot more freedom to design your output the way you want. You can try to mimic what was done in the video and get the credit for it, but however you choose to output your ecosystem, the following general requirements must be met:

Each animal must be one-of-a-kind, meaning they must be distinguishable from any other animals and the background. In the example video, this is done by using a different color for each animal against a brown background. You do not have to do it this way, for example, you can choose to use an image for each animal instead of a colored tile.

There must be a command log which displays commands as they are being executed. In the example video, this is done in a TextArea at the bottom of the Ecosystem.

Animals must visually move around the ecosystem.

Grading Criteria
Half of the PA8 grade will correctness. For this assignment, this is the GUI output. You should also expect that we might run your program with additional input files besides the ones provided. We will also be viewing your demo video.

The other half of the PA8 grade will be your decomposition and code clarity.

Decomposition
Points will be taken off for copy, pasted, and edited code that should have been encapsulated in a method.

Should carefully select data structures that implement the required functionality.

Your program should contain 10 or less java files. All of the Java files should be <350 lines of code. We won't be including the usage instructions in the file header.

Each method should be less than 30 lines. This INCLUDES comments, but not the method header. It is easier to read a function if it can all fit on one screen.

Make things as simple as possible.

Don't use lambda functions or other features in non-standard ways.
Reduce the amount of conditional nesting as much as possible.
Declare collection variables using interface types.

Your code should be decomposed well. main should be a good summary of your program and no method should be overly long or trivial. Your methods should not be chained. Do NOT have main just call one method that does everything.

Redundancy is a grading focus; some tasks are similar in behavior or based off of other tasks. You should avoid repeated logic as much as possible.

Code Clarity

YOU should be able to read, understand, and explain your own code to someone else a couple days after you wrote it.

No magic numbers
No methods written to just get the test cases to work
There needs to be a balance between no comments in the body of the methods and a comment for every line in the program. Either extreme will result in points off.

The file header should include instructions on how someone would use this program. To use the program, one would need to know the input file format.

Use meaningful variable names. Loop iterators can be simple (i for integers, s for strings, n for numbers, etc.).

We will be modeling some of the issues we are seeing with code.

We will ask permission to show clear code examples.

The coding style in terms of spacing, etc. should be done automatically every time you save in Eclipse. As long as you stick with those defaults, the syntax style should be fine. At workplaces the style requirements can be extensive. In this class, we have the following requirements:

No lines should be longer than 80 characters line.
Do not mix tabs and spaces. Use spaces consistently.
The left curly brace should start on the same line as the loop or conditional.
Remember, we will be grading the code that you submitted for PA6 again. Therefore, you must fix any errors that were pointed out in your PA6 grading or receive further deductions.

Submission
For the third peer review assignment, you are required to submit your PA8Main.java file to Aropa AND to Gradescope for the PR3: PA8 peer review assignment. NOTE: There is a SEPARATE Gradescope assignment for the peer review. ONLY submit PA8Main.java to Aropa.

For this assignment, you are REQUIRED to submit all of the following files to Gradescope before Wednesday November 7th at 11:30pm.

All the Java source files needed to run your program.
myEcosystem.in
myEcosystem.mp4, or other video format that can be run on multiple platforms
To create the video, you can use a program to record your screen as you run your program (see OBS instructions above), or you can simply record your screen with your smartphone or tablet. Do note however that the video you submit must be of good enough quality for the SL's to clearly see your ecosystem and command logs.

Write your own code. We will be using a tool that finds similar code.

It is recommended that when talking with others about the assignment, do not write anything down.
